## ✨ Project Introduction 
The Industry Night Website is a responsive, mobile-first platform designed to showcase the achievements of Interactive Media Design students at Fanshawe College. The site highlights individual student portfolios, Level 4 client projects, testimonials, and event information, while also promoting the IDP3 program through visuals, interactivity, and dynamic JavaScript content. 


Industry Night is an annual event where IDP3 students present their work to employers, industry professionals, faculty, and peers. The website acts as a digital hub for the event – providing details, interactive showcases, and long-term visibility for student achievements. 


This is a collaborative project across multiple courses (Multimedia Authoring, Web Development, Electronic Image Production, and Motion Design), combining technical coding, UI/UX design, video editing, and animation into one integrated showcase.
